This JavaScript repository provides a prototype for managing bank accounts in a simulated environment. The BankAccount function is designed to create instances of bank accounts with essential functionalities. Each account instance is initialized with details such as account number, account holder name, account type, initial balance, and an isActive flag to indicate the account's status.

Features:
Deposit: The deposit method allows users to add funds to their account, ensuring the deposited amount is greater than zero.
Withdrawal: The withdraw method enables users to withdraw funds from their account, given the withdrawal amount is valid and does not exceed the available balance.
Balance Check: The checkbalance method provides users with the current balance in their account.
Account Status: The isActive method checks if the account is active or inactive based on the isActive flag.
Use this repository to explore and understand basic banking operations in a JavaScript context. Feel free to create additional instances (p2, p3, etc.) and customize the example usage section to fit your specific requirements."
